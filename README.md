# Introduction
This is an old university project for the advanced programming course. I recently had a look at it to catch up on Java and some basic concepts and decided to share it here.

# Plato
Plato is meant to be like Steam, where players sign up and download their favorite games. The players also have stats and profiles.

# Battle Ship
Battle Ship is the only available game in Plato and can be downloaded and played. It's a 2-player client-server multiplayer game that uses web sockets for communications. The server authenticates each player with Plato before allowing them to play.
